# Security Policy

## Supported release

The current plugin version is 1.0.0.

## Security design

Peyvast Auth treats browser requests as untrusted. State-changing REST requests require a plugin nonce and same-origin validation. Administrative routes additionally require the `manage_options` capability. Guest nonce identities use a negative namespace distinct from WordPress user IDs, and guest challenges are bound to an opaque random HttpOnly SameSite cookie. OTPs, verification tokens, and identifier hashes are represented by site-keyed HMACs in the database, expire, have bounded attempts, and are consumed once.

Server-side security state applies limits by relevant scope and dimensions such as IP, network, identifier, and IP/identifier combination. Fixed-window enforcement rejects requests at the configured limit, while password failures are handled with generic responses. Unknown email OTP logins and unknown password-reset identifiers receive success-shaped neutral responses — same status, cooldown, and expiry shape, with nothing stored or delivered — so account existence cannot be inferred from the API; rate limits still apply identically to probing attempts. Login page settings accept only published or private pages, and custom redirects are restricted to the local site. Provider credentials and sensitive response fields are excluded from safe REST success payloads, credentials are never placed in request URLs, provider diagnostics redact credentials and raw response bodies, and operational logs use stable error categories rather than raw database error text.

OTP provider delivery is asynchronous: the plaintext code is never placed in Action Scheduler arguments, logs, or API responses. It is encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) in the dedicated delivery table. The encryption key is derived from the WordPress deployment secrets via `wp_salt('auth')` — never from a database-stored option — so a database dump alone cannot decrypt queued codes. Each background job re-validates the challenge immediately before sending, so an invalidated, replaced, expired, or consumed challenge can never be delivered. All configured channels are mandatory: only failed channels are retried (the queued payload is rewritten to the remaining channels), and on permanent failure of a channel the challenge is invalidated so a session can never be restored from an undelivered code. There is no synchronous provider fallback; queue failure fails fast before provider HTTP work.

## Deployment requirements

Use HTTPS, keep WordPress/PHP and integrations updated, protect administrator accounts, use provider credentials with the minimum available privileges, configure realistic provider timeouts, and monitor delivery failures without recording OTPs or secrets. Test reverse proxies so the application sees the correct site URL and secure-cookie behavior. Google JWKS refreshes preserve the prior cache if Google is unreachable. WordPress Studio's SQLite compatibility layer is for local development; production should use MySQL or MariaDB because the plugin uses MySQL-native locking and SQL behavior. The plugin detects a non-MySQL engine at runtime and surfaces an admin notice instead of silently reporting a ready schema.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not disclose an unpatched vulnerability in a public issue. Contact me through the repository owner's verified private security channel and provide the affected version, environment, impact, reproduction steps or proof of concept, and a proposed mitigation. Remove credentials, user data, OTPs, cookies, and provider secrets from the report.

The maintainer should acknowledge the report, reproduce it, assess severity, prepare a fix, and coordinate disclosure. Configure GitHub private vulnerability reporting or a verified security contact before public release.
