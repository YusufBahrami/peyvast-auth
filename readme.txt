Phone & email OTP login, password sign-in, registration, and password recovery for WordPress — with Google sign-in, SMS/email providers, and WooCommerce support.

== Description ==

Peyvast Auth brings modern, phone-first authentication to WordPress. Visitors sign in with a one-time code delivered by SMS or email — no password to remember — while existing users can still log in with their password. Registration, password recovery, and optional Google sign-in are built in.

= Authentication features =

* OTP login and registration via SMS or email, with resend cooldowns, expiry, and bounded attempts
* Password login supporting phone, email, or username resolution
* Password recovery that revokes all existing sessions and never auto-signs the user in
* Optional secondary OTP delivered to the user's email when one exists
* Optional Google sign-in with full local ID-token verification (signature, issuer, audience, and claims)

= Built for your stack =

* Server-rendered Blocks and Bricks elements, plus a back-button block
* WooCommerce integration: customer phone synchronization, account/checkout/order-receipt redirects, and HPOS compatibility
* Pluggable SMS and email provider adapters, configured under the Providers settings with a built-in test endpoint
* Customizable HTML OTP email template with locale-aware document direction and no forced Persian/RTL markup
* Tools to migrate existing users to verified phone numbers
* Translation-ready, including a bundled Persian language pack

= Security first =

* OTPs, verification tokens, and identifier hashes use site-keyed HMACs — never plaintext
* Nonce and origin validation plus argument schemas on every REST route, with public permission callbacks enforcing both
* Guest nonce identities use a negative namespace, and guest challenges are bound to an HttpOnly, SameSite cookie
* Server-side rate limiting with IP, network, and identifier buckets, threshold-correct fixed-window enforcement, and progressive blocking
* Enumeration-neutral responses: unknown email logins and unknown reset identifiers return a success-shaped response with nothing stored or sent
* All configured delivery channels are mandatory; failed channels are retried independently and never silently skipped
* Redirect page IDs are validated against published/private pages and custom URLs are restricted to the local site
* Google key refreshes preserve an existing JWKS cache when the upstream endpoint is unavailable
* Provider credentials are sanitized, never sent in request URLs, never returned in API responses, and redacted from diagnostics; delivery encryption keys derive from the WordPress deployment secrets, not the database
* Privacy export and erasure for phone data, aligned with WordPress privacy tools

Activation creates five dedicated InnoDB tables for OTP challenges, the phone identity index, operational logs, security state, and the encrypted OTP delivery queue. Operational logs redact sensitive values and support retention cleanup. Background maintenance (challenge/log/security-state cleanup, schema watchdog, phone migration, and identity-index rebuild) runs on the bundled Action Scheduler, which coexists with WooCommerce and other plugins that provide Action Scheduler. Data removal on uninstall is conditional on the "delete data on uninstall" setting and includes migration cancellation state. Production deployments should use MySQL or MariaDB; WordPress Studio's SQLite compatibility layer is intended for local development.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/peyvast-auth`, or install the ZIP via Plugins → Add New.
2. Activate **Peyvast Auth**.
3. Open **Peyvast Authentication → Settings**.
4. Configure at least one SMS provider or WordPress email delivery.
5. Add the **Peyvast Auth** Blocks or Bricks element to a page.
6. Test all enabled flows on staging before production use.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is WooCommerce required? =

No. The WooCommerce integration is optional and only activates when WooCommerce is present. When enabled it synchronizes customer phone numbers and supports account, checkout, and order-receipt redirects.

= Can users sign in without a password? =

Yes. Visitors request a one-time code by phone number or email, receive it through the configured SMS or email provider, verify it, and a session is created. If no account exists yet, the same verification can complete registration (Registration is phone number only / Email Login is Optional).

= Does Google sign-in need extra configuration? =

Yes. Enable it in settings and provide your Google client ID; the plugin verifies ID tokens locally — structure, algorithm, signature, issuer, audience, and claims — before creating the session.

= What happens to my sessions after a password reset? =

All existing WordPress sessions are revoked and the user must sign in again. The verified reset code is bound to the intended user and consumed during the password update.

= Where is my data stored? =

Settings and operational keys live under the `peyvast_auth_` namespace. Five custom tables store OTP challenges, the phone identity index, redacted operational logs, security state, and the encrypted OTP delivery queue. Uninstall cleanup is conditional on the administrator's "delete data on uninstall" setting.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0.0 =
First release. Background work runs on the bundled Action Scheduler: OTP delivery is asynchronous and encrypted at rest, recurring maintenance is batch-limited, and the phone migration and identity-index rebuild are chained jobs with retries and recovery. Registration and password reset finalize their verification tokens only after every coupled write succeeds, all configured delivery channels are mandatory with per-channel retries, and unknown accounts receive enumeration-neutral responses. REST routes have argument schemas and nonce/origin permission callbacks, provider credentials are never placed in URLs or logs, and delivery encryption keys derive from the WordPress deployment secrets. Identifier hashes are site-keyed, guest nonces use a separate namespace, redirect page settings are validated, and migration state locking is serialized. WordPress 6.8+ and PHP 8.1+ are required. Production deployments should use MySQL or MariaDB.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Action Scheduler integration with bundled 4.1.0 bootstrap and multi-plugin version arbitration
* Asynchronous encrypted OTP provider delivery with challenge re-validation and bounded retries
* Recurring maintenance: OTP challenge cleanup (15 min), log retention and security-state cleanup (daily), schema watchdog (daily)
* Phone migration and identity-index rebuild as chained, idempotent, retryable background jobs with watchdog recovery
* Lazy phone migration moved to background processing
* WordPress 6.8+ and PHP 8.1+ required
* All background work runs on the bundled Action Scheduler
* New `{prefix}peyvast_auth_otp_deliveries` table for the encrypted delivery queue
* Site-keyed OTP identifier hashes, isolated guest nonce IDs, validated login-page redirects, threshold-correct rate-limit prechecks, and serialized migration state locks
* Safe JWKS cache refresh behavior and complete uninstall cleanup for migration cancellation state
* Token-ordering fix for registration and password reset (token consumed only after all coupled writes succeed, released on failure, account rolled back)
* Mandatory-channel OTP delivery with per-channel retries; enumeration-neutral responses for unknown email/reset identifiers
* Full core `authenticate` chain parity for password login; delivery encryption keys derived from deployment secrets; no backward compatibility with previous plugin versions
* REST argument schemas and nonce/origin permission callbacks; provider credentials never in URLs or diagnostics; redacted operational logs
* Runtime database-engine detection with an admin notice; in-process lock fallback for non-MySQL environments
